# Wireless-neonatal-monitoring
Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) play a crucial role in monitoring the health of newborns, necessitating constant vigilance regarding their vital physiological signs to catch any critical conditions early on. Traditional monitoring systems often rely on wired sensors and manual oversight, which can lead to discomfort for the babies, restrict their movement, and create delays in responding to emergencies. To tackle these issues, we’ve developed a Wireless Neonatal Monitoring System that employs non-invasive biomedical sensors alongside an ESP32 microcontroller. This innovative approach allows for real-time data visualization and integrates machine learning to enable continuous health surveillance specifically designed for infants. Our system is capable of measuring essential vital signs including heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), body temperature (T), blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation (SpO₂) through small, non-invasive sensors that are part of a wearable unit. These sensors gather data, which is then processed by the ESP32 module. This module transmits the information wirelessly to a cloud-connected dashboard, allowing healthcare professionals to monitor the infants remotely. We’ve also implemented an AI-powered predictive model using a Random Forest Regression algorithm trained on various physiological datasets. This model classifies the vital parameters as either normal or abnormal, and it can trigger immediate alerts if any anomalies are detected. The dashboard interface is not only user-friendly but also displays ECG patterns, SpO₂ readings, and even geolocation data, making it a valuable tool for both hospital settings and on-the-go applications. Throughout this project, we prioritize aspects such as low power consumption, biocompatibility, data security, and the ability to scale and integrate smoothly with existing NICU infrastructures. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance the quality of neonatal care by providing a smart and efficient health monitoring solution that ensures early intervention, leading to better health outcomes for newborns.
